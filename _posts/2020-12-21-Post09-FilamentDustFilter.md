This post shows another filament dust filter make of 2 parts, a cover and a base parts.
Both are shown in the Figure 2a and 2b, respectively.

		width: 46%;
		padding: 2%;
	}
	
	/* Clear floats after image containers */
	.row::after {

It has 2 cutouts for inner 3mm nuts that can be used to mount the filter on a 
wall of the printer with the help of 1 or 2 button screws of 3 x 12mm.


The cover was designed with a 0.5mm of tolerance in radius for a tight fit. 
Moreover, both parts have 3mm holes to secure these with button screws of 
3mm x 6mm, just in case.
