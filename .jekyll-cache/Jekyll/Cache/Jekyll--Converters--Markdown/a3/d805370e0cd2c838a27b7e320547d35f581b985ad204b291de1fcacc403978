I"Ô<p>In this post, I show how to measure distance with the cheap ultrasonic sensor HC_SR04. The main contribution is to provide a class in C++ with implemented methods to get the distance with this sensor. This class is part of a whole library that can be found  <a href="https://github.com/wgaonar/BeagleCPP">here</a>. There a few <a href="https://tutorials-raspberrypi.com/raspberry-pi-ultrasonic-sensor-hc-sr04/">working examples</a> for this sensor using Python on the Raspberry Pi instead of the BeagleBone or in <a href="https://sheldondwill.wordpress.com/2014/02/04/using-an-ultrasonic-sensor-hc-sr04-with-a-3-3v-micro-controller-tiva-c-series/">3.3V microcontrollers</a>. But, I did not found one example for C++.</p>
