I"Œ<p>In this post, I show how to drive the stepper motor 28BYJ-48 with the driver <a href="https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/uln2003.pdf">ULN2003</a> which can drive a wide range of loads including solenoids, relay DC motors, LED display filament lamps and thermal printheads. In practice, this driver can be found in a popular green-coloured board that has been designed to make it easy to play and interact with the 28BYJ-48 as <a href="https://lastminuteengineers.com/28byj48-stepper-motor-arduino-tutorial/">this </a> and <a href="https://www.luisllamas.es/motor-paso-paso-28byj-48-arduino-driver-uln2003/">this another tutorial</a> show.</p>
