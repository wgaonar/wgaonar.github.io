I"¹<p>In this post, I show how to blink a LED with using Delays routines. This is done through the implementation of some functions that retrieve the time and duration of time marks in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C++</code>. These functions are like the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">millis()</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">micros()</code> in Arduino. In a <a href="/Post11-BeagleBone_LedOn/"> previous post </a> I showed how to make a blink on la LED using Delays, in contrast, in this post I show how to use the new functions to signal time events without the need to freeze the BeagleBone while it is doing the delay.</p>
