I"†<p>In this post, I will show you how to make a flashing on a pair of LEDs, i.e., turn
on and off a Led but with a different duration between the state on and state off.<br />
I will be using the C++ library described in the post 
<a href="/Post13-BeagleBone_LEDClass/"> BeagleBone Black and C++</a> to 
access and control the general purpose digital pins (GPIO) pins of the BeagleBone.</p>
