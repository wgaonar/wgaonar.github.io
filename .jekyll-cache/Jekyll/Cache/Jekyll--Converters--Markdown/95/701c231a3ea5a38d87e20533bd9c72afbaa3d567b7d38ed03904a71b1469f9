I"„<p>In this post, I will show you how to read a button with the BeagleBone Black. I have written a <a href="/Post12-BeagleBone_ButtonLed/"> previous post</a> that shows the same behavior. The difference with this post is that here, I have written a C++ class that contains specific methods to work with buttons. This class is part of the C++ library to access and control the general purpose digital pins (GPIO) pins of the BeagleBone that I started to work in and described in these posts <a href="/Post10-BeagleBone_GPIOClass/"> BeagleBone GPIO C++ class </a> and <a href="/Post16-BeagleBone_BUTTONClass/"> BeagleBone Button C++ Class</a></p>
