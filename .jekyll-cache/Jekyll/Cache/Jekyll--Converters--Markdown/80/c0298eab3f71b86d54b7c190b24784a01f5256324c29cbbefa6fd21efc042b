I"ä<p>In this post, I show off a Bluetooth four-wheeled mobile robot with Arduino Uno. It uses the classic ‚Äúyellow‚Äù DC gear motors but It has an HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor to get the distances to the surrounding objects. One remarkable aspect is that the Phone app to control the robot can show these distances in a sonar-like graph, i.e., the app lets bidirectional serial communication with the Arduino Uno, one direction to control the DC gear motors and the other to ask for the distances measures. The post makes a review like a <em>little state of the art</em> about similar and popular projects and lists its main features for the reader.</p>
