I"ß<p>In this post, I show how to control the brightness of a LED with a potentiometer. The LED is wired to a PWM pin and the Potentiometer to an ADC pin. Remembering that the BeagleBone has 7 analog inputs and ADC of 12 bits that let the user to represent an analog signal within a range of 4096 values. It is important to remember that the reference for analog voltage is <font color="red">1.8V</font>. If the user provides a greater voltage, the BeagleBone could be damaged.</p>
